## Details

This is a booking system project built with frontend and backend techniques.

Based on the project planning, the team developed a restaurant booking system with the goal of delivering a web application. At the web application, the user can add a booking by choosing amount of people, date and time of booking. The booking system will tell the user if the picked option is fully booked.

The application also has a simple admin page where admin can edit the existing bookings and create new bookings.
